# Game Jolt Translations

All our copy in one repo so that we can translate into other languages. Should cover the [whole site](http://gamejolt.com) as well as the [Game Jolt Client](http://gamejolt.com/client). This project contains the translations for the [gamejolt](https://github.com/gamejolt/gamejolt) repository.

**Warning!** Don't commit to this project directly. Instead, use our [translation management system](https://poeditor.com/join/project/B4nWT6EgnD) so that everyone can collaboratively work on the translations at: https://poeditor.com/join/project/B4nWT6EgnD. Pull requests to this repository will be rejected.

There's a lot of stuff in code that needs to be pulled into this repo because CROS was lazy during development. Shame on him. More site copy and terms will be pulled in as time goes on.
